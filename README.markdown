# Markdown Previewer

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/vanbc18/pen/GROBbjx](https://codepen.io/vanbc18/pen/GROBbjx).

First of all, I had to do research on what markdown language is. In a nutshell, Markdown language is a simple way to write HTML without using tags.

Then I used React Hooks and Bootstrap to build my previewer. I also learnt about the Renderer() function and dangerouslySetInnerHTML attribute.
